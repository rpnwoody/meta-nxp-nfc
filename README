OpenEmbedded/Yocto layer for NXP's NFC stack
============================================

This layer provides support for NXP's NFC NCI driver, user space lib,
and demo application.

The layer is SoC/CPU agnostic and can be used with any OpenEmbedded/Yocto
Project BSP, as long as the base layers provide board support for at least
the 4 NFC essential signals required by the NFC shields:

*I2C Clock from the processor
*I2C Data from the processor
*IRQ from the NFC board to the processor
*Enable signal from the processor to the NFC board

Dependencies
------------

This layer depends on:

URI: git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
branch: master
revision: HEAD

Testing
-------

The following environment has been used for development and tests:

Boards: i.MX6UL-EVK + OM5577/PN7120S

OpenEmbedded/Yocto BSP layers

URI: git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
branch: master
revision: HEAD

URI: git://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded
branch: master
revision: HEAD

URI: git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-fsl-arm
branch: master
revision: HEAD

To test the NFC stack integration, one can add the nxp-nfc-bin package to
any system image. The bin package is provided by the same recipe that provides
the nxp-nfc lib package, which in turn depends on the external kernel driver
module package, also part of this layer.

Once the system is up and running, the following command will poll for
NFC tags, and will print the content read from the NFC tag to the screen:

# nfcDemoApp poll


Notes
-----

The SW stack enabled by this layer is custom implementation, non-compliant to
the mainstream Linux NFC Project.

Additional information about the SW stack is available in the following
